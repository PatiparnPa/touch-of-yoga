                <p className={styles.indent}><span className={styles.fairBoldText}>THE MARKET WAS FULL OF PLAIN YOGA JEWELRIES</span> that had no true worth, uniqueness, and meaning. These pieces felt like just another piece of metal, identical from one another. On the other hand, high-end pieces often cost too much for most people to afford.</p>
                <p className={styles.indent}>This first <span className={styles.fairBoldBigText}>"Why"</span> led our design team to dig deeper. We examine the reasons why there was no meaningful yoga jewelry at all.</p>

                <p className={styles.indent}>Many brands play it safe with the same old trends because they're scared of trying new things. By playing safe instead of taking risks, they avoid bold ideas and distinctive elements, which leads to a market full of boring similar designs. <span className={styles.fairBoldBigText}>"Why"</span> At TouchofYoga, we dare to be different. We take smart risks to create stand-out pieces that challenge the norm and become conversation starters.</p>
