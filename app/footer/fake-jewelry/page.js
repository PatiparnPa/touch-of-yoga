Terms like "luxury finish" or "high-quality look" can give a false sense of value, causing buyers to misunderstand what they are actually purchasing. The idea of owning fancy jewelry can be very attractive, causing people to buy things just because they look nice and they trust the brand. However, finding out the truth later can be disappointing and make people feel tricked.  This is a big problem because it hurts people's trust and then takes advantage of those consumers who may well lack the expertise to differentiate between real and fake materials.</p>

                <h1>Spotting the Signs of Fake Jewelry</h1>
                <p>To avoid getting tricked into buying fake jewelry, be aware of common signs and practices that try to fool buyers:</p>

                <ul className={styles.decimalList}>
                    <li><span className={styles.decimalSpan}>Unclear information or confusing terms:</span> Real jewelry should have clear information regarding the materials used, such as "14k gold" or "natural sapphires." Many brands in the market use unclear words, for example “gold jewelry", where in fact it is “gold-plated jewelry” with an unknown base metal.</li>
                    <div className={styles.rightImageTextContainer}>
                        <Image
                            src="/images/footer-content/fake-jewelry/fake-jewelry5.jpg" // Update with your image path
                            alt="Description of image"
                            width={200} // Adjust width as needed
                            height={200} // Adjust height as needed
                            className={styles.image}
                        />
                        <li><span className={styles.decimalSpan}>Price Too Good to Be True:</span> If any piece of jewelry is much cheaper compared to similar ones from other, it might be a warning sign. Real precious metals and gemstones have a set value, so big discounts could mean that the jewelry is not as advertised. On the other hand, fake jewelry might sometimes sold at prices equal or even higher than real pieces, which might make people believe they are getting a good deal. This misleading pricing can make it hard for buyers to tell the difference between genuine and fake jewelry.</li>
                    </div>

                    <div className={styles.divide}></div>

                            className={styles.image}
                        />
                        <li><span className={styles.decimalSpan}>No Certification:</span> Real gemstones and high-quality metals usually come with certification from trusted gemological institutions. Many jewelry brands provide these certificates to prove their products are real and high-quality. These certificates are official papers that confirm the authenticity of the materials and the quality of the craftsmanship.</li>
                    </div>

                    <div className={styles.divide}></div>

                    <li><span className={styles.decimalSpan}>Check the Quality:</span> Poor craftsmanship, like improper settings or obvious flaws, might mean the jewelry is fake. High-quality pieces are usually well-made and show careful attention to detail.</li>
